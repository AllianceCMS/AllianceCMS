**IMPORTANT!!!** The AllianceCMS installer is now functional, feel free to play with the system, try to break it, and submit bug reports! Be sure to read Install.md, as the core system is located outside of the web server Document Root!

(The installer will be updated periodically as we move towards an official Alpha release, so check back often for updates!)

##Development Notes

### Code Doc Blocks

We have been working on documenting the AllianceCMS code as we go (we do have to feel confident that a piece of code is close to completion before documenting). As part of documenting the code, we have been working on keeping an updated list of @todo task tags, so any modern IDE should be able to give you a list of what tasks are out there.

The existing API documentation ([http://api.alliancecms.com](http://api.alliancecms.com)) and the task tags should give you a good idea of what the system looks like now, and what it's going to look like in the near future.
