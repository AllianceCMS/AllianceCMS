- [CHG] Altered implementation of Route::generate() to encode param tokens
  using rawurlencode() instead of urlencode().
    
- [CHG] Altered the implementation of Route::isMatch() to decode matching
  parameters using rawurlencode().

- [CHG] In Route::generate(), use strtr() instead of str_replace() as a more
  secure mechanism

- [NEW] Specific exceptions: RouteNotFound and UnexpectedType

- [CHG] Map now throws UnexpectedType when attach route spec is bad

- [BRK] Map now throws RouteNotFound when generate() cannot find the named
  route

- [CHG] Docblock and README changes from Akihito Koriyama, Hari KT, and Stan
  Lemon

- [CHG] Map::match() now requires the $server param to be passed

- [ADD] New notation for wildcard matching; in addition to /*, we now have
  {:foo*} for optional wildcard params, and {:foo+} for required wildcard
  params. Thanks, Chris Doherty, for the report that led to this feature.
