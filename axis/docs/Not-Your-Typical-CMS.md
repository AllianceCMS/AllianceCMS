#AllianceCMS: Not Your Typical CMS

AllianceCMS is not just "Another CMS". AllianceCMS is different. It's an Open Source CMS that has a very specific target audience: People, Groups and Institutions that want to build great and unique Communities!


AllianceCMS, is (we believe) the only open source/fee CMS that's built from the ground up specifically to address building Community websites.


We'll provide you with a few use cases.


Case 1:
A Real Estate Broker can install AllianceCMS and the main/landing pages will focus on the agency as a whole. But the Brokers agents can create 'Venues', which are specific to that agent. The agent will be able to provide contact info, enable plugins that will list the MLS listings they manage personally, and much more.


Case 2:
A book club wants to create a web presence. The main/landing pages can represent the club, ongoing events, schedule meetings. But individuals, or the club itself can create venues for specific books. Those venues can use plugins to hold discussions regarding the book. Members can supply links or info that's pertinent to the specific title, list author signings, and much more.

Case 3:
A national restaurant chain can install AllianceCMS. It would use the main/landing pages for information/deals nation wide. But then individual locations can have/create a 'Venue' that has information that is specific to their location, like contact info, special deals or events that are specific to their location, and much more.

Now that's great, but how you administrate the system is great too.

First, a user registers for the site. They can then create a venue (if the main site admin allows it). A registered member can also request to be a member of a venue (if the venue admin allows it).

Main site admins can install plugins, create links and setup permissions that venue admins can have access to, and then allow venues to have access to those plugins, links and permissions.

The venue admin can then have full control as to which plugins, links and permissions they would like to use, and they can even choose where plugin blocks are displayed (left side, right side, footerj). As of right now the main content of a plugin is displayed in the center of the site.

So there is major flexibility for both Main Site Admins and Venue Admins. It's also setup so that the entire site can be the community, or the main site is the glue that ties together many communities, made up of venue creators/admins and venue members.

So as you can see, this is not a typical CMS, and it's focus on certain types of site, not the typical blog/forum, one-to-many site most CMS's focus on.

I feel the landscape has a great selection of one-to-many website creation tools and CMS's. I have a few use cases like the ones I mentioned above that I have planned, but the existing solutions were a one-to-many platform with very limited many-to-many implementations. And to create the use cases that I want to create, I'd spend almost just as much time coding as I do on this system, and still be limited in area's that a custom solution can address.

That's why I've decided to create something from the ground up that focuses on a many-to-many at it's very core.

Having said that, there's nothing stopping you from restricting access to Venue creation, not creating any venues on your own, and using AllianceCMS as a one-to-many solution :-)
