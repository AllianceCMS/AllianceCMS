There are BC breaks in this release, but it's a Google beta, so ...

- [SEC] Based on conversation at
  http://www.eschrade.com/page/generating-secure-cross-site-request-forgery-tokens-csrf/
  start using openssl and mcrypt for CSRF tokens instead of mt_rand().

- [NEW] SegmentInterface, Randval, RandvalInterface.

- [BRK] The Manager now requires $_COOKIE as its third param to Manager.

- [CHG] Segments now lazy-load themselves. On reads, they will reactivate an
  available session, but will not start a new one. On writes, they will
  reactivate an available session, or start a new one if one is not available.
  This means that creating a segment object no longer starts a session; you
  have to read from or write to one for the session to start.

- [BRK] Renamed Manager::isActive() to isAvailable(), to differentiate from
  PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE. ( Previously, isActive() only told you if a session had
  started, not if one was available to be activated.)
    
- [CHG] Manager::getSegment() no longer starts a session

- [CHG] Manager::isStarted() now checks getStatus() for PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE
  instead of session_id().

- [CHG] Segment::__get() no longer returns a reference

- [BRK] Renamed Manager::getSegment() to newSegment()
    
- [CHG] Manager no longer retains session segments

- [CHG] Various typo and doc fixes by Akihito Koriyama
